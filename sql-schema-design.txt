Scaler Schema Design: 

Req: 
1. Scaler will have multiple batches 
2. For each batch, we need to store the name, start date and current instructor 
3. Each batch of scaler will have multiple students 
4. Each batch has multiple classes 
5. For each class, store the name, date & time and instructor for the class 
6. For every student, we store their name, grad year, university name, email and phone number 
7. Every student has a buddy, who is also a student 
8. A student may move from one batch to another 
9. For each batch a student moves to the date of starting is stored 
10. Every student has a mentor 
11. For every mentor, we store their name and current company 
12. Store information about all mentor sessions (time, duration, student, mentor, student rating and mentor rating) 
13. For every batch, store if it is "Academy Batch" or "DSML Batch"

Steps to follow for schema design : 
1. Identify the nouns in the requirements and see if we need to store information about it. If yes, create a table for it. 
2. Figure out the PK and what all direct attributes you need to put inside the table. 
3. Start looking for relationships between tables and find out the cardinality between them. 
4. Based on the cardinality, represent the relationships 
  1:1 -> Either side id on either side 
  1:m or m:1 -> 1 side side on m side 
  m:m -> mapping table
